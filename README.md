Recently Played Albums
======================

This was inspired by [Casey Pugh's iPhone/iPad/iPod syncing logic](http://fncy.it/m5zIiT) 

In Casey's post, he creates a playlist of the most recently played songs big enough to fill your device. I love the idea. However, I like to have the entire album on my device.

So my ideal solution wolud be to look at the tracks I've most recently played and put that entire album into the playlist. You can't do that with Smart Playlists. So I created this AppleScript to do it.

To get it to work, create the playlist Casey talks about:

  "One smart playlist that selects recently played songs up to 70% of your iPhoneâ€™s hard drive space. For example, if you have 16GB you would limit the playlist to 11GB."

Save that as "Most Recently Played Tracks" 

Then just run this applescript, you'll have "Most Recently Played Albums"

A total hack, but it works.
